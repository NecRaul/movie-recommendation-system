# movie-recommendation-system

Movie Recommendation System for a school project. Data taken from Kaggle.

## Requirements

Everything depends on `pandas` and even more so on `sklearn` (`scikit-learn`).

You can install these packages by running

```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How it works

It asks for the movie name and how many movies you'd like to be shown and then gives similar movies based on your inputs.

For in-depth explanation, you can check the comments in `main.py`.
